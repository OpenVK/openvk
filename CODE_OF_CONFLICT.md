The OpenVK development effort is a very personal process compared to "traditional" ways of developing software.
Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and criticism.
The review will almost always require improvements to the code before it can be included in the repo.
Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success of OpenVK.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable.
If so, please contact the community manager @WerySkok and report the issue.

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved. We are all humans,
and frustrations can be high on both sides of the process.
Try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other."
