h1. OpenVK 2

*OpenVK* is an attempt to create a simple CMS that -cosplays- imitates old VK. Code provided here is not stable yet.
VKontakte belongs to Pavel Durov and mail.ru.
To be honest, we don't even know whether it even works. However, this version is maintained and we will be happy to accept your bugreports "in our bug-tracker":https://github.com/openvk/openvk/projects/1. You should also be able to submit them using "ticketing system":https://openvk.su/support?act=new (you will need an OVK account for this).

h2. Instances

* *"openvk.su":https://openvk.su/*

h2. Can I create my own OpenVK instance?

Yes! And you're very welcome to.
However, OVK makes use of Chandler Application Server. This software requires extensions, that may not be provided by your hosting provider (namely, sodium and yaml. this extensions are available on most of ISPManager hostings).
Simply put, we would recommend you to use latest CentOS (running on your own VDS/Dedicated) with latest PHP from EPEL. We used to have this configuration on our "testing instance":https://openvk.su/ and thus will be able to provide quicker support for OVK running in this environment.
If you want, you can add your instance to the list above so that people can register there.

h3. Installation procedure

1. Install Composer, Node.js, Yarn and "Chandler":https://github.com/openvk/chandler
2. Install "commitcaptcha":https://github.com/openvk/commitcaptcha and OpenVK as Chandler extensions and enable them like this:


* ln -s /path/to/chandler/extensions/available/commitcaptcha /path/to/chandler/extensions/enabled/
* ln -s /path/to/chandler/extensions/available/openvk /path/to/chandler/extensions/enabled/


3. Import install/init-static-db.sql to *same database* you installed Chandler to
4. Import install/init-event-db.sql to *separate database*
5. Rename openvk-example.yml to openvk.yml and change options
